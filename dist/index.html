    <h4>Here are the meets we decided to investigate:</h4>

    <p>
      The Olympics don't need an introduction. It's the competition where the
      best competitors come every 4 years to fight for the gold medal.
      However, some things to note are that women weren't allowed to compete
      until the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. Even then, women were limited to few
      events. Additionally, the 5000m and the Triple Jump (two events we chose
      to investigate) were not competed in the women's division until 1996.
      Also, results from competitions during the Cold War are widely
      considered to be tainted by doping from both the United States and the
      Soviet Union
      (https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A175877048/AONE?u=anon~a6be528b&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;xid=2dd8fa62).
    </p>

    <p>
      The World Athletics Championships (Formerly the IAAF World
      Championships) is a competition hosted by World Athletics (Formerly the
      IAAF), the governing body of Athletics (the umbrella term for Track and
      Field & Road Racing). It is held every two years and brings out the best
      competitors from all around the world, much like the Olympics.
      <!-- There also exists an indoor counterpart, which we decided to use for comparing Indoor Track and Field results -->
    </p>

    <p>
      The CIF State Championships is the Championship meet for Californian
      High School Track and Field Athletes. For the most part, it's a two day
      meet, with prelims hosted on a Friday and the finals hosted the
      following day. Although we were able to find results as far back as the
      1920s, It's important to note that most track events (100m, 200m, 400m,
      1600m) were replaced by their imperial / english counterparts (100yd,
      220yd, 440yd, 1 mile). Appropriate conversions were added
      (https://www.ustfccca.org/assets/track-event-conversions-standardized.pdf).
      Additionally, older meet results often lack depth, with only the fastest
      times being recorded. We make sure to note down (n), or the number of
      times in our sample.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Arcadia Invitational is a meet hosted in Arcadia, California. It
      attracts notable athletes nationwide (and even internationally). It is
      known primarily for its 3200 event, where record-breaking numbers of
      performances occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The UIL State Championships is the Championship meet for Texan High
      School Track and Field Athletes. The meet is spread throughout 3 days
      and across 6 divisions.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>We also wanted to choose an indoor championship meet so that we could also evaluate indoor performance. Confusingly, the two top indoor meets in the nation, currently known as New Balance Nationals Indoor and Nike Indoor Nationals, have a very mixed past. Nike and New Balance have sponsored the same meet in different years. To prevent confusion, we decided to look at the results from the National Scholastic Athletics Foundation (NSAF) hosted meets. Present day, this meet is refered to as Nike Indoor Nationals.</p> -->

    <p>
      We decided to make a maximum sample size of 8 per sprint event (since
      standard tracks have 8 lanes), 12 per distance races (1600 and 3200),
      and 12 per field event (since 12 is the standard size of a field
      flight).

    <h3>Further Research</h3>
    <p>
      Further areas to analyze include Indoor Track and Field Competition,
      Cross Country, and the NCAAs. Notably, the introduction of more and more
      international athletes and older athletes look to have impacted the
      competitiveness of Collegiate Track and Field.
