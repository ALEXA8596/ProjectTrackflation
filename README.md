# ProjectTrackflation
A small project of mine where I compare the "inflation" in track and field inflation between high school(, collegiate,) and professional levels.

## Todo

### Track and Field
- [X] CIF TF State Meet

- [X] Olympics

## Conversions
CIF Track used the Imperial Measurement system until 1980. Conversions were done as recommended by the NFHS.
