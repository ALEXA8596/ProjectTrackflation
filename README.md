## Scraping

This Repository contains the data scraping scripts and the data analysis scripts used during the process of writing this paper.

See Results Scraping/CIF TF Scraping/README.md and Results Scraping/Olympics TF /README.md for help on how to execute each of the folders.

## Athletic Helper NPM Module

The ``athletichelper`` npm module is a module that I've been working on for around 2 years. While writing this paper and scraping results, I've continued to edit, build upon, and utilize athletic helper. Check it out at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/athletichelper">npm</a> or under the AthleticNetWrapper folder in this github repo

## Athletic Helper Chrome Extension

The Athletic Helper Chrome Extension is another Athletics-related project I've been working on for a while. I've continued to use, edit, and build upon it during the writing of this paper. It's published on the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/athletic-helper/gdnmapolllodbicoalbfpainmldmabek">Google Chrome Web Store!</a> Feel free to download it!

## Conversions
CIF Track used the Imperial Measurement system until 1980. Conversions were done as recommended by the NFHS.
